### Actual Homework ###
#
# Simple ATM program
#
# Using exception handling code blocks such as try/ except / else / finally (NB: the more the better, but try to use at least two key words
# e.g. try/except) write a program that simulates and ATM machine to withdraw money.
# Tasks:
# 1.	Prompt user for a pin code
# 2.	If the pin code is correct then proceed to the next step, otherwise ask a user to type in a password again.
#       You can give a user a maximum of 3 attempts and then exit a program.
# 3.	Set account balance to 100.
# 4.	Now we need to simulate cash withdrawal
# 5.	Accept the withdrawal amount
# 6.	Subtract the amount from the account balance and display the remaining balance (NOTE! The balance cannot be negative!)
# 7.	However, when a user asks to ‘withdraw’ more money than they have on their account, then you need to
# raise an error an exit the program.

find_pin = int(input("Welcome. Please enter your pin number: "))
pin_no = 4211

def get_pin_number(find_pin):
    try:
        if find_pin != pin_no:
            raise Exception
        print("Your account balance is £100")

    except:
        print("The pin number is incorrect, please try again")
