Homework: Lesson 14 – Process Flow Design

Question 1
Design a cinema booking system.
Think how you would approach the problem and what are potential ways of solving it?
You do not need to write actual code, but describe the high-level approach:
• Draw a list of key requirements
• What are your main considerations?
• What would be your common or biggest problems?
• What components or tools would you potentially use?
• You are welcome to draw a diagram (a very simple one) for the process flow to explain how it is going to work.


# key requirements:

- a system that can:
    -  book, cancel, amend, update booking information
    -  manage group bookings
    -  manage discounts and promotions
    -  be able to visually show seating plans and allow customers to choose where to sit
    -  hold customer profiles, details and purchase history and store receipts
    -  hold all film screening information and be regularly updatable, change in live time
    -  be able to scan a barcode or QR code to print tickets if necessary
    -  manage mailing lists and permissions for these

- a relational database that can hold all the above information (cinema viewings, bookings, customer details, payment details, viewing details)
✓✓ what are your main considerations? ^ is key requirements, below is other cons?

# Other considerations:

- Waiting lists for cancellations or preview viewings
- taking into consideration social distancing and ensuring bookings have adequate empty spaces between them
-  being able to save/retrieve bookings and hold transaction data
-  admin issues: logins, check credentials, manage forgotten password retrieval
✓

# common or biggest problems:

- Ensure no double bookings for seats
- Ensure only number of tickets sold per viewing that the theatre can accommodate
- Data privacy – for all data held
- Ensure data all held safely and securely
✓

# Components / tools to use:

-  SQL  (for database)
-  Python (for back end)
-  HTML/Javascript (for front end)
-  servers
✓✓ (what would the servers be for? only one missing a bracket explanation, Im guessing
just to host this all / website etc?)

- payment processing systems:
  -	Stripe
  -	Paypal
  -	ApplePay
^ Many of these hav e their own API usually too, particularly Stripe!
