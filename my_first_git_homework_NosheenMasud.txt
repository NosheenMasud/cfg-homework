Definitions for key Git & GitHub terminology

 GIT WORKFLOW FUNDAMENTALS 
•	Working Directory - Umbrella term, all files / folders e.g. when checked out. Where all the files are that we’re working to
•	Staging Area - Tracked files / part-of-next-commit files. Git watches these files for changes
•	Local Repo (head) -  Area of local changes (laptop or PC)
•	Remote repo (master) - Remote area (Server)

WORKING DIRECTORY STATES: 
•	Staged –  Staging: preparation. Commit-prepped (area that is prepped for commit)
•	Modified - Modified files: changes made
•	Committed – saved the file

GIT COMMANDS: 
•	Git add  - Add file contents to the index
•	Git commit  - Record changes to the repository
•	Git push - Update remote refs along with associated objects
•	Git fetch - Download objects and refs from another repository, explaining all the new stuff that has been added/updated
•	Git merge - Join two or more development histories together
•	Git pull - Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch


Personal notes:
git commit -m 'initial commit'  (always add a message of what you’re adding)
git push origin main  (inside cfg-homework folder)
git add .   (. Adds everything, otherwise you can name file you wanna add)
git init   (Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one)
ls 
rm
cd
touch - create files
